###### In this portfolio, you will find several projects that showcase my skills and experience in SQL. Each project is unique and presents a different set of challenges and opportunities for me to demonstrate my abilities.

###### Here is a brief introduction to some of the projects you will find in this portfolio:

## Customer segmentation

The objective is to segment customers based on their demographics and purchase history, and identify patterns and trends in their behavior. This project is based on a problem I encountered during my internship so the data source is confidential.

- This code will retrieve the customer data, and create new columns by segmenting the data based on income, age, and purchase frequency. Then it will group the data by these segments and count the number of customers in each segment.
- You can use this code to run the query on your database and see the results, which will be a table showing the size of each segment and the patterns and trends of the customer data.

## Instagram Cloning project

For the Instagram cloning project, I worked on instagram cloning data which would allow users to analyze their Instagram data and gain insights into their behavior and performance on the platform. The project aimed to demonstrate my ability to work with data, extract insights, and communicate the results effectively.

## International debt analysis

International Debt Statistics (IDS), successor to Global Development Finance and World Debt Tables, is designed to respond to user demand for timely, comprehensive data on trends in external debt in low- and middle-income countries. we are gonna analyse and find the trends in the international debt data provided by the international debt statistics.

We are going to find the answer to questions like:

- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt?
